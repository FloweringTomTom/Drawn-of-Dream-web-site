</p>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Financial support</li>
    <li>Effective communication</li>
    <li>Team building</li>
    <li>Strategic planning</li>
</ul>

<h2>Goals</h2>

<p>An Ember community should provide useful elements of survival: shelter, nutrition (including food and water), medical care, education, and information. It would do this as its fulfilment of its objective of managing the various needs of a society, by enabling people to be effective participants in that society.</p>

<p>One role of Ember would be to provide goods. For this, it would be ideal for Ember to control as much of the supply chain as possible. That would allow efficient provision of the goods such as to reduce cost and ensure quality. That control of the supply chain would, in an ideal scenario, extend to all stages of the process, from production of the raw materials to component production to assembly to distribution, as well as shipping at all stages of the process. If Ember both controlled production of raw materials in a region and was the dominant institution working to ensure that those resources are used responsibly, it would of course be important to take the interest Ember has in using the resources sustainably into consideration.</p>

<h2>Project structure and implementation</h2>
<p>Ember will achieve these goals through creating individual components that each provide an integral part of the whole societal system. Implementation will probably need to be undertaken in stages.</p>

<h2>Rationale</h2>
<p>Human society is sometimes unpredictable in the rights and safeties it affords. Consequently, a unified institution with the aim of remedying these issues should be established outside of the realms of traditional governmental structures. Participation in Ember communities shall be dependent on agreement to specified terms, to best protect the rights of the individuals making up the community.</p>

<h2>Licensing</h2>
<p>Aside from sections 2 and 3 of the <a href="/library">Ember Library</a>, all portions of the Ember project should be compliant with the Ember Freedom Requirements, and all portions of the project original to Ember should be compliant with the Strict Ember Freedom Requirements. This is likely not yet a legally effective license, due to a lack of available legal expertise to work on it.</p>

<h3>Ember Freedom Requirements (EFR)</h3>
<p>For given Information to be compliant with this standard, the following must be true:
    <ul>
        <li><span class="important-word">Self-contained</span>: All information necessary for the full and complete use of the Information must also be EFR-compliant.</li>
        <li><span class="important-word">Redistributable</span>: The Information must be legally redistributable.</li>
        <li><span class="important-word">Source included</span>: The preferred form for editing the Information must be available and EFR-compliant; when used by Ember, if the Information is in a form that is not the preferred form for editing it, a copy of the Information in the preferred form for editing it must always be included with the other copy.</li>
        <li><span class="important-word">Irrevocable</span>: The restrictions on the Information that make it EFR-compliant must be irrevocable.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h3>Strict Ember Freedom Requirements (SEFR)</h3>
<p>This is the same as the Ember Freedom Requirements, with the following restrictions:
    <ul>
        <li><span class="important-word">Requiring non-misleading attribution</span>: Attribution to the source of the Information must be required; if the Information is a derivative work, it must be made clear that it has been modified from the source information.</li>
        <li><span class="important-word">Editable</span>: It must be legal to modify the Information, and to redistribute both modified and/or unmodified copies of the Information.</li>
        <li><span class="important-word">Mandatory publication</span>: The Information must be promptly published and made available at the cost of distribution or less.</li>
        <li><span class="important-word">Copyleft</span>: These requirements must be required to apply to all derivative works of the Information.</li>
        <li><span class="important-word">Restricted use</span>: The Information may not itself be used as or as part of advertizement or propaganda, although it may be used as a tool for their creation.</li>
        <li><span class="important-word">Irrevocable</span>: The restrictions on the Information that make it SEFR-compliant must be irrevocable.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
