<p class="hatnote-emphasis-warning">Wreathe 7.3 is currently in development and is not yet supported. To install Wreathe, using <a href="/ancillary/wreathe">a current version</a> instead is recommended.</p>

<h2>Provisional supported system requirements</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Intel Core 2 CPU or compatible, with at least two cores</li>
    <li>At least 128GB available disk space</li>
    <li>Compatible GPU (Intel recommended)</li>
    <li>Color display (4K (UHD) 250+ ppi with multitouch digitizer recommended)</li>
    <li>At least 8GB RAM</li>
    <li>Compatible keyboard (any standard IBM-compatible should work) (keyboard with built-in three-button pointing stick recommended)</li>
    <li>Compatible pointing tool (may be part of the keyboard) (TrackPoint, mouse, etc.) (three-buttoned pointing stick or thumb-trackball mouse recommended)</li>
</ul>
<p>It is probably possible to install Wreathe 7.3 on computers that do not meet the requirements to be supported. Note that systems that do not meet the recommended requirements are supported as long as they meet the basic requirements.</p>

<h2>Development Version Installation (not supported; for development and/or testing)</h2>
<p>During development, Wreathe 7.3: Elegiac is distributed as a Portage overlay, and requires a working Gentoo GNU/Linux installation. To install it, first add the overlay to the system by running:<br />
<pre><code>layman -o https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ethus3h/wreathe-overlay/master/wreathe-overlay.xml -f -a wreathe-overlay -p 100</code></pre><br />
<!-- FIXME should also set up a binhost, and optionally then rebuild everything -->Then, emerge the base package by running:<br />
<pre><code>layman -s wreathe-overlay; emerge wreathe-base</code></pre></p>
<p>Note that in my installation, <code>/var/db/pkg</code> is a symlink to <code>/Ember\ Library/Ember\ satellite\ projects/wreathe-package-db</code>.
