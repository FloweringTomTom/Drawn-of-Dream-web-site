<h1>At Lost Tree</h1>

<p>At Lost Tree, we wear many hats, often worn by guest musicians. We write and record music in many genres and styles. We offer production support for musicians wanting to record for public release or to create demos. We can create new music for many uses, from live performance, to YouTube videos, to background for the spoken word. We also offer piano and guitar lessons for adults.
</p>
<p>Whatever your musical endeavor, we'd be happy to talk with you and help you find a way to make it happen.</p>
