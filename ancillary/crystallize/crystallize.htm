<h2>Overview</h2>
<p><span class="hatnote-emphasis">This command is part of the <a href=".">Crystallize</a> package; see <a href=".">the package page</a> for installation instructions.</span></p>
<p>This command provides the main functionality of Crystallize, an app to easily archive files stored in computer-accessible digital formats.</p>
<p>Note: There is an oddity in the version numbering: version 2.15.5.9.1 was followed immediately by version 2.15.5.9.3 (skipping 2.15.5.9.2); version 2.15.5.9.2 was then released following version 2.15.5.9.3 (and is identical to version 2.15.5.9.3 aside from the version number); normal numbering then resumed with version 2.15.5.9.4, .5, .6 etc. following version 2.15.5.9.2 (skipping version 2.15.5.9.3, as that number was already used).</p>

<h3>Usage</h3>
<h4>Syntax</h4>
<figure class="center-figure app-syntax">
    <code>crystallize &lt;files&gt;</code>
    <p>where &lt;files&gt; is the filename or filenames on which to operate</p>
</figure>
<p>If relative path names are used for &lt;files&gt;, the file(s) being crystallized must be within the current directory. The script tests for some simple violations of this requirement, but not all of them. Be careful that you don't crystallize your current working directory, or the crystallize scripts themselves; doing either of those could cause problems.</p>
