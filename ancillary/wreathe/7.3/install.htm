<p class="hatnote-emphasis-warning">Wreathe 7.3 is currently in development and is not yet supported. To install Wreathe, using <a href="/ancillary/wreathe">a current version</a> instead is recommended.</p>

<h2>Provisional system requirements</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Intel Core 2 CPU or compatible, with at least two cores</li>
    <li>At least 64GB available disk space</li>
    <li>Compatible GPU (Intel recommended)</li>
    <li>Color LCD display</li>
    <li>At least 8GB RAM</li>
    <li>Compatible keyboard (any standard IBM-compatible should work, such as the IBM SpaceSaver II)</li>
    <li>Compatible pointing tool (TrackPoint, mouse, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>It is probably possible to install Wreathe 7.3 on computers that do not meet the recommended system requirements, but that is not supported.</p>

<h2>Development Version Installation (not supported; for development and/or testing)</h2>
<p>During development, Wreathe 7.3: Elegiac is distributed as a Portage overlay, and requires a working Gentoo GNU/Linux installation. To install it, first add the overlay to the system by running:<br />
<pre><code>layman -o https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ethus3h/wreathe-overlay/master/wreathe-overlay.xml -f -a wreathe-overlay -p 100</code></pre><br />
<!-- FIXME should also set up a binhost, and optionally then rebuild everything -->Then, emerge the base package by running:<br />
<pre><code>layman -s wreathe-overlay; emerge wreathe-base</code></pre></p>
<p>Note that in my installation, <code>/var/db/pkg</code> is a symlink to <code>/Ember\ Library/Ember\ satellite\ projects/wreathe-package-db</code>.
