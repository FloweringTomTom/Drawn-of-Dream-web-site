<h1>about.me: Signup experience commentary</h1>

<p>I signed up for the Web site <em>about.me</em>. These are my thoughts on the user experience of signing up for it.</p>

<p>The sign up process is presented as a series of steps. The home screen shows a summary of the Web site's purpose, and has some buttons for beginning the sign up process. It is layed out like:
    <pre>logo          [Get your page] [Log In]
        
                    Summary Copy
                  Lorem ipsum dolor
                  
                [Get your free page]
              or sign up with _Google_
               
               [below-the-fold content]</pre>
    My goal when visiting the Web site was to complete a sign up process. The layout provides four obviously interactive elements: two buttons in the upper right, a button in the center, and a link. The button in the center duplicates the leftmost button in the upper right, although the addition of the word "free" in the button in the center helps reassure visitors who don't want to spend money that they don't have to. I think having the button in both places is helpful, because in the center it is in a prominant location, and it is probably the likely interaction target, either immediately or eventually, of most visitors to the page. (There should, of course, be a sign-up button near the log-in button, because they are conceptually related, and when a user has found a log-in button but does not have an account, they would look near it for a sign-up button. Log-in and sign-up interaction targets are usually found in the upper right corner of Web sites, and it is good to not violate that expectation.) There is one problem on this page, though, which is that the "sign up with Google" link is kind of faint and small, compared to the other visual elements on the page, meaning that people who want that would possibly click on the main button when they actually wanted the link, and then have to click back to get to the link. A better way to communicate this might be either to have two equally prominent buttons. Since "sign up with Google" is what I wanted, I clicked that link to continue. (Because the below-the-fold content was below the fold, and didn't seem necessary for signing up, I didn't read it.)</p>
    <p>The second step of the sign-up process was a quick and painless, as usual for OpenID transactions.</p>
    <p>Third, upon returning to about.me, I was prompted to confirm my identity by photograph and name, I suppose to ensure I had not signed in using someone else's Google account. This seems reasonable to me, and was quick and simple to accomplish.</p>
    <p>Fourth, the Web site requested my name. This went smoothly because it used the name from my Google account, but the Web site falls into the common trap of presenting two separate fields for the name, when one field would allow easy input of a wider range of names (e.g. names with three parts, names with one part, etc.). If the Web site wants to use the separation of names to know a name for informal or formal address, it should simply ask for those forms: a person named "Gregory Chomikuj II" could supply "Greg" as their preferred form of informal address, and "Sir Chomikuj" as their preferred form of formal address. Trying to guess these, while possibly producing correct results <em>most</em> of the time, means that they will be <em>wrong</em> some of the time, frustrating, confusing, or alienating the Web site's users.</p>
