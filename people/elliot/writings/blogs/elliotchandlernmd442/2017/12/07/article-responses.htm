<p>In the introduction to this article, the author writes that "the experience consumers have with your company <em>is the product</em>" (emphasis in original). This statement was quite striking to me. It makes me wonder whether because of this, non-profit organizations may supplant for-profit companies, especially Web companies, as Wikipedia (from the nonprofit Wikimedia Foundation) has done to some extent for encyclopedias. Nonprofits often have a much better public image than for-profit companies, and their Web sites generally have a much nicer user experience due to the elimination of intrusive third-party advertizing, being replaced by grants and donation funding.</p>
