<h2>Abstract</h2>
This is a proposal for developing an information technology system that allows various types of data to be given a first-class role; this is part of a broader proposal to develop and facilitate collaboration on a specification, a computing environment, a library, and a model community, to serve as resources and infrastructure for innovative communities.
<h2>Background</h2>
This part of this project will challenge the power structures of information technology corporations by providing a free/libre alternative to their services. The goal of the project is not to destroy or defeat corporations <em>per se</em>, but simply to challenge them by developing an alternative system that respects freedom and openness. If the project creates something valuable enough, corporations would presumably become <em>unnecessary</em>, although people certainly might continue to maintain them, probably mostly in the context of, for example, family-owned local business and such, simply out of their choice to do so. There is nothing wrong with people choosing to run and patronize businesses; this project aims merely to provide a superior alternative to them so that people are not <em>forced</em> to patronize and advertise for them. For instance, owning common consumer goods often tends to turn one into a walking billboard through the presence of built in advertising on products (game: count how many logos are on the things you are carrying with you at school!). This should <em>not</em> be necessary to be able to participate practically and meaningfully in society. Rather, it should only be something that people could choose if they explicitly wanted to — <em>not a default</em>.
<h2>Explanation</h2>
This project has a very large scope. Consequently, for this Approach, the target goals would be more limited. A practical implementation target for the context of this class project is the development of a simple state-machine–driven interpreter of the token-based document format specification for the information technology environment aspect of the project. Such an implementation could initially target either JavaScript/JQuery, or Bash. JavaScript/JQuery would allow the project to be portable on the Web platform, and perhaps allow implementing graphical user interface elements of the project sooner, while Bash would allow a character-mode textual user interface, perhaps a command-line environment. Either of these types of implementations of the format is valuable, regardless of the language they are developed in, and should be developed at some point; for this project only one would really be practical for meeting the implementation target within the context of this class, most likely. Consequently, I will need to make a decision about which to pursue first.

I would like to thank my classmates for their feedback on the project, and Jeremy Mason for mentoring me during an earlier iteration of the development of some of these ideas.
