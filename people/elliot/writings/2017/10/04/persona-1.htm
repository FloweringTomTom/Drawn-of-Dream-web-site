<h1>Customer Persona #1</h1>

<p>Jody is a 46-year-old power company electrician, living in upstate New York, in a rural area near a town with 15,000 residents. They get about 45 inches of snow each winter, in six to ten storms in a typical year. Because Jody needs to go to job sites when there are power outages — typically during storms — they often have to leave their driveway when it is snowing. Because of this, having an on-demand plow service app is critical to their business, so they can get out of their driveway. Jody makes about $30,000 per year, and has a 13 year old Scion xB SUV as their vehicle. Because the vehicle isn't very good in the snow, and is unable to accommodate a plow, Jody can't plow their own driveway.</p>

<p>Jody has a smart phone, so they can use a Web interface for making snow plowing requests. Jody needs an app that is simple and easy to read, because they have a hard time using software that is low-contrast, small, or otherwise hard to see, due to failing eyesight.</p>

<p>For Jody, getting their drive way plowed quickly when they need to go to work is important. They are willing to pay more for plowing than the base rate, so they would find it useful to be able to offer a bounty for expedited service in the plow app. Jody has a few close friends, and goes to community events often, but is not influential in the community. Their personality is usually quiet but strong and not shy. Jody is not an early adopter of new technologies, usually waiting until they have become quite mainstream to investigate them. Jody values precision and focus in lifestyle.</p>

<p>Jody is a profitable regular customer of the snow plowing app.
