Boxy communities

In <i>Little Boxes, Glocalization, and Networked Individualism</i>, Barry Wellman postulates a model of community networks based on large general communities that are formed of many smaller semiquantizable, interlinked community networks, represented as undirected graphs. From this, it becomes evident that the boxes are representative of the smaller discrete units of groups such as families, friends, etc. while the larger boxes are the larger groups such as towns or nations; the groups of little boxes and big boxes can be regarded at various scales in the same manner, such that the large boxes are nations, and the smaller boxes are subnational divisions.
