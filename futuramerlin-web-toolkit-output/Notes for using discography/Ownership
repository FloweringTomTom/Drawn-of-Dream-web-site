chown -R "$USER:$USER" ~/Drawn-of-Dream-web-site
then run: sudo !!
chown = change owner
-R = recursive
"$USER" = variable that contains the name of the currently logged in user
"user-name:group-name" specifies who owns the file, and what group of people has permission to work with the file
so "$USER:$USER" means "you" for the owner, and "you" for the group
~ means your home directory
/ is the path separator
so ~/whatever is a path to a file named "whatever" in your home folder
the "sudo !!" bit is because I forgot to prefix the first command with sudo
!! means the previously run command
yup
so "sudo !!" will get evaluated as "sudo chown -R ..."
chmod 000 whatever
chmod 700 whatever

760: owner permission = 7
group permission = 6
everybody else = 0
Read permission = 4
write permission = 2
execute permission = 1
so, read+ write = 4+2 = 6
read/write/execute = 4+2+1 = 7
write only = 2

man chmod
chmod +x file
