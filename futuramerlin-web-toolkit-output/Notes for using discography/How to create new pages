<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This section documents the Ember computing environment: a centralized append-only information store, a computer operating system integrated with that information store, and related specifications. This is a work-in-progress draft, and everything here is subject to change and is not presently suited for implementation.</p>

if you put that contents in "page-name.htm", then u can put a link to "page-name.html" in the navigation bar
and it'll link to that content
yup
The link should go to .html
The file contents go in .htm
That's just a weird thing about the way my toolkit works: the input files are called .htm, and the finished files are called .html
np

the input .htm files aren't formally correct HTML, but I guess it's close enough for Web browserse

(they make an effort to display even very badly written HTML reasonably)
The input files get transformed into correct HTML (theoretically) by the generator software

(Correct HTML will include a note at the beginning indicating what "character encoding" (mapping of digital data to text characters) the document uses)

(The encodings used commonly in Web documents almost all use the same mappings for common Latin-alphabet letters, which is why the encoding declaration can be encoded in the encoding it declares :P)

(— is not as common a character,so without a declaration Firefox picks an old Windows encoding, I think, in hopes that that's what it is, and — shows up weird in that)

Breadcrumbs are a navigational aid showing the logical path to a Web page
relative to the home page

Using them, a reader can get a spatial sense of where the current document is in the semantic hierarchy of the Web site.

If a visitor is using traditional Web browsing, having started at the home page and followed links, going down a level in the semantic hierarchy with each link, the breadcrumbs show the path they took to get to the current page.

They're called breadcrumbs from "Hansel and Gretel" fairy tale , wherein bread crumbs were used to record a physical navigation path

"I can put pictures in, right?"

Those don't need anything too complicated, just HTML
Changing the colors is a little more tricky, but shouldn't be *too* bad

basically it just needs to change the path to the CSS file in the header template
(the same file where you change the other stuff)
the navigation stuff

Or you can add styles to the existing styles

But yeah by replacing that with a different CSS file than m.css (say, drawn-of-dream-site-theme.css) and making that file (just put it in the root of your Web site)
you can completely swap out the appearance of the site
