To find help about git, use Konsole, and type "man" for "manual" followed by whatever manual I want to see, like one for git, or one for bash, for for different commands, like man git commit or man git pull

IA doesn't provide manual, so use ia help or ia help upload, etc

with that green background
make it look like a hippie car
