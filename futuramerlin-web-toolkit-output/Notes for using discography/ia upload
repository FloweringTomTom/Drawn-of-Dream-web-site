 
To upload flac files or any other type to IA, use the command: ia upload followed by the IA identifier, which is found in the URL for the IA page I am uploading to. So it looks like this:

ia upload <identifier> followed by the file path, which I drag and drop, as though I am dropping the actual file, but because the preferences tell it to, it drops only the path into the Konsole.

Many file paths can be dropped simultaneously after the identifier. So the whole string looks like this:

ia upload <identifier> <file><file> etc ...
