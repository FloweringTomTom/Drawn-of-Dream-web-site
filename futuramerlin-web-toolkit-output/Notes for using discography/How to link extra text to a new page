They could also go on a separate page, and have a link there
like, a key/value pair: "Notes: <a href...>CD Baby Album Notes</a> â€¢ <a href...>CD Baby Description</a>" if they are too big on that page but you want to show them anyway
It seems like nice information to have though
I'm just trying to figure out what feature(s) are needed to support what you're trying to do there
Cool, thanks.
