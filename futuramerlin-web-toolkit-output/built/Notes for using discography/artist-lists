To define the artists, put them in like:
artist,elliot-chandler
nextArtistType,×
artist,futuramerlincom
will show up as "Elliot Chandler × Futuramerlin.com"
or artist,elliot-chandler
nextArtistType,, and
artist,futuramerlincom
will show up as "Elliot Chandler, and Futuramerlin.com"
I haven't tested it, but you should be able to hook multiple ones together:
artist,elliot-chandler
nextArtistType,and
artist,futuramerlincom
nextArtistType,feat.
artist,whoever
would come out as "Elliot Chandler and Futuramerlin.com feat. Whoever"

In the list, the ones with special types like "and" will still get the and listed in the table, so it shows up as Artist: Elliot Chandler / Artist: and Futuramerlin.com
because i'm not sure how better to display those. There's probably a way, but I don't know what it is, lol
anyway, enjoy!
(that's not a technical challenge, just a matter of I don't what the ideal way of displaying the info. is)
