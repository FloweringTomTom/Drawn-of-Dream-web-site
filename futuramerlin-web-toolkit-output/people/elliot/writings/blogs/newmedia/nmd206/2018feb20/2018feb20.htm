The goal of the project is not to destroy or defeat corporations <em>per se</em>, but simply to challenge them by developing an alternative system that respects freedom and openness. If the project creates something valuable enough, corporations would presumably become <em>unnecessary</em>, although people certainly might continue to maintain them, probably mostly in the context of, for example, family-owned local business and such, simply out of their choice to do so. There is nothing wrong with people choosing to run and patronize businesses; this project aims merely to provide a superior alternative to them so that people are not <em>forced</em> to patronize and advertise for them. For instance, owning common consumer goods often tends to turn one into a walking billboard through the presence of built in advertising on products (game: count how many logos are on the things you are carrying with you at school!). This should <em>not</em> be necessary to be able to participate practically and meaningfully in society. Rather, it should only be something that people could choose if they explicitly wanted to — <em>not a default</em>. <h2 id="Explanation">Explanation</h2> This project has a very large scope. Consequently, for this Approach, the target goals would be more limited. A practical implementation target for the context of this class project is the development of a simple state-machine–driven interpreter of the token-based document format specification for the information technology environment aspect of the project. Such an implementation could initially target either JavaScript/JQuery, or Bash. JavaScript/JQuery would allow the project to be portable on the Web platform, and perhaps allow implementing graphical user interface elements of the project sooner, while Bash would allow a character-mode textual user interface, perhaps a command-line environment. Either of these types of implementations of the format is valuable, regardless of the language they are developed in, and should be developed at some point; for this project only one would really be practical for meeting the implementation target within the context of this class, most likely. Consequently, I will need to make a decision about which to pursue first. <h2 id="Pictures">Pictures</h2> Here is a picture of the latest mockup of this proposal, running in a Web browser. <img class="alignnone" src="https://github.com/ethus3h/ember-web-site/raw/master/people/elliot/writings/blogs/newmedia/nmd206/2018feb20/Screenshot_2018.02.20_13.55.26.png" alt="" width="3840" height="2160"> &nbsp; <h2 id="Interactive_mockup">Interactive mockup</h2> Here is an interactive mockup of a proposed user interface for the project. <a href="http://futuramerlin.com/people/elliot/writings/blogs/elliotchandlernmd442/2017/12/06/12799819e/">http://futuramerlin.com/people/elliot/writings/blogs/elliotchandlernmd442/2017/12/06/12799819e/</a> <h2 id="Credits">Credits</h2><p></p> I would like to thank my classmates for their feedback on the project, and Jeremy Mason for mentoring me during an earlier iteration of the development of some of these ideas. </main> </body> </html>
