Scholastic, who distributed many of his remarkable albums, had requested an album of lullabies from him, but he could not record them himself because of mounting health problems. I was only 18 at the time, and, unaware of the reason he couldn't take on the project, immediately accepted the challenge. I never heard from him again about it, and the next time I saw him, a few years later, it was in the hospital; he has left an amazing legacy.<br><br>Bruce had planted in me an idea, and it never left me. It was many years before I even approached the project, though. In 2006 I started one incarnation of such an album, but didn't get far. Then, in 2009, my friend "Nina" asked that I create accompaniments for lullabies she had recorded for her grandchildren. Shortly after that, Patrice Lockhart asked if I would write more for harp. Interestingly, I had been having difficulty conceptualizing the accompaniments until then: the piano seemed too percussive and heavy a presence for Nina's Lullabies.<br><br>The combination of voice and harp seemed perfect to me, and over the next year I wrote arrangements for all of the songs recorded. They came out so well, I asked "Nina" if she would allow me to publish them. Well, some of them: all were wonderful, but one was a Christmas song, and several had copyright issues. Six, though, were original works, and two were in the public domain.<br><br>And yet eight didn't seem like quite enough for an album ...<br><br>So I added one of my own. And then, to come full circle, I called Ted Pandel, who co-wrote Goodnight Elephant with Bruce Haack, told him of this project, and asked permission to include that song, which had first appeared on Bruce's album Ebenezer Electric. I had loved it since I was a boy, and it seemed right to include it here. I'm sure you will agree!<br><br>Recording of the songs was originally planned for the summer of 2012, but with Patrice working full-time as a psychiatrist and many other factors of busy-ness at work in both of our lives, it was put off until last fall, 2015. All of the recording happened over the course of 2 or 3 months, and I have had the recordings waiting for processing since then.<br><br>As I have learned from experience (and from an article by Chris Robley from CD Baby), one of the biggest problems of self-producing is actually getting material produced. The temptation is to never finish, because there is always something that can be made "just a little bit better!" With that in mind, this summer I determined to get these beautiful songs online where people would have a chance to know them.<br><br>But this downloadable album is only part of what is planned! Emily Bracale, who painted the watercolor that graces our album art, has beautifully illustrated several of the songs, and we hope to create a songbook/CD package at some point. If you see value in that idea, the best way you can help is by telling others about Nina's Lullabies, or giving the album as a gift.<br><br>This has been a project of joy and of love. I am forever grateful to "Nina," Patrice Lockhart, Erin Chenard, Jon Poupore, and Emily Bracale, and to Gail Kaiser, who designed the album art. Seeing and hearing what we have been able to accomplish together, I'm sure you will understand why. </main> </body> </html>
