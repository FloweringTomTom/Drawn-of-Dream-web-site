<h1>Test Your ActiveX Installation</h1>
This page tests whether you have your browser properly configured to download,
authenticate, install, and display ActiveX controls, and manipulate them
with VBScript.
<p>When prompted with a certificate, accept it. The current date and time should appear
below:<p>
<center>
<OBJECT classid=clsid:9732FB42-C321-11D1-836F-00A0C993F125 codeBase="mhLbl.cab"
height=30 id=label1 width=200>
	<b>ActiveX is not supported</b><p>
</OBJECT>
</center>
If you see the current date and time displayed above, ActiveX and VBScript are
working properly, and you should go back to the page you were looking at.
<p>If, instead of the time, you see a box with a small x in it, either you
don't have ActiveX installed, you don't have ActiveX enabled, you aren't running
an Intel processor and a 32-bit version of Windows,
you don't have a currrent version of Authenticode, or you didn't
accept the certificate. 
<p>If you see a blank space, you probably have ActiveX 
working but not VBScript. 
<p>If you see the message <b>ActiveX is not supported</b>, then
you are using a browser that doesn't recognize the Object tag at all.
<p>If you think you've corrected any problem you are having 
with this, refresh this page to try it again.</p>
