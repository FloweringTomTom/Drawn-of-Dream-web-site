====== How to survive school ======
tried and true method from experience! (jk, it is NOT recommended to use some of this method since you will besicalyl be in deep shit academically, and it devalue your learning) (Some of this is good advice and some is bad advice)

See belowfor actually how to survive in school (with out me trying to be funny)

 ===== Useful skills ===== 

  * Work ethic and ability at continuing to work for a long time without getting distracted 
  * If former item somewhat lacking, bullshitting 
  * Also Poker face while bullshitting 
  * If first item REALLY lacking, flipping burgers 
  * Looking smart while bullshitting — it is possible to come out looking moderately intelligent while talkin out of ur ass. E.g. by being ELOQUENT and having good vocabulary. If you say things in a coherent, academic manner, it helps you look confident. 
  * Look kind of shy and unconfident while bullshitting.E.g, Preface with what you say with, like, "im not sure about this, it might be a little crazy but it kind of occurred to me that maybe" etc. This will make you seem more remarcable when what you say is right, & when you are wrong you wont look like such a idiot after it because you didn't seem to be confident in it urself.. 
  * Look neat and scholarly. This wil help out avoid (probably correct) assumptions that might be made about you based on your appearance (eg. prof thinking well he looks stupid so i will grade him like he is) Also use deodorant lol 
  * Act really engaged with the material. It is good to be a good actor for this if u have a problem doing it naturally. 
  * Always be respectful and polite — it buy you points with the prof, eg say "thank you for the class" after class. then they will take what you say moreauthoritatively Seem a little shy/demure while doin this too. 
  * Dontt go over teh top with the acting stuff here — a little medcicine goes a LOOOONG way and if u look fake your basically fucked 
===== Humanities (honors) ===== 
  * Get reading done. 
==== How to read humanities texts ==== 
  * Can help to read aloud. But, works best with SUMMER reading etc where u have lots of time for. Because, readig aloud takes longer than a efficient silent reading. EVen tho it is sometimes easier to keep goin when reading aloud, thus it is faster. 
  * Audio book version sometimes help people (also time consuming) 
=== prose (treatises, fiction, and the like === 
=== poetry & plays === 
  * really good for the read aloud technique 
=== textbooks === 
  * photo copy the text book, and highlight it while reading. 
  * Or, use ebook version with a ebook reading software that allows highlighting 
  * Pay attention to nested, structured headlines — this provides a nice hierarchical way to see what the info is. 
  * Copy stuff onto flash card may be useful.
==== How to save ur ass when you screw up ====
=== Haven't done (haven't completed) the reading === 
== If u havent completed the reading by class time == 
  * Use aforementioned bullshitting and lookin smart skill. 
  * It is good to appear knowledgeable 
  * "spark notes" is ur friend, but read at least a bit of OTHER summary since prof knows whatis in spark notes summary and will expet u to know at least somethin else 
  * If shakespear use spark notes no fear shakespeare modern english translation. it's fairly shitty writing, but it is quick to read and avoids the likelyhood of missunderstanding something horribly in the originial version as a consequence of not having read all of it. If out of time, read the END of the document in this format, and the rest of it in summary form 
  * Know who the characters are — spend some time getting them straight since this is valuable for in class discussion
