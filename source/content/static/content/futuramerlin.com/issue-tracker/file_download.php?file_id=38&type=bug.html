<h3>What is Native Client (NaCl)?</h3>

<p>
Native Client (NaCl) is an open-source browser plugin that provides a sandboxed environment
for running native code in the browser. This provides websites with access to native
processing power, which in some cases may be an order of magnitude faster than javascript.
</p>

<p>
Games are not the only thing that NaCl can be used for, but they do demonstrate
the impressive computational abilities of NaCl.
</p>


<h3>Is Native Client safe?</h3>

<p>
Native Client applications must adhere to strict rules to prevent
escape from the sandbox. An application which does not follow these
rules will never be loaded.
</p>

<p>
You can read more (including the research papers) at the
<a href="https://developer.chrome.com/native-client">Native Client Website</a>
</p>

<h3>The demo is not loading</h3>

<p>Native Client is still experimental technology, and may not work on
all systems. If it doesn't work on your system, <a href="feedback.html">let me know</a>.
Please include your OS, version of Chrome, and processor type.</p>

<h3> What is that number in the upper left corner?</h3>

<p>Frames Per Second. The original doom does not have this, but
it was added for this demonstration. The original Doom is fixed
at 35 fps, since the game physics is tied to the framerate.</p>

<h3>Why does this only work on Chrome?</h3>

<p>
The original version of Native Client was developed for Firefox using the
NPAPI (Netscape Plugin Application Programming Interface) plugin interface. However,
this legacy interface was found to be limiting. A new plugin interface was
developed at Google, called Pepper API (PPAPI), to allow Native Client to reach
its full potential.
</p>

<p>
Chrome has PPAPI support, but Mozilla has
<a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/NPAPI:Pepper">decided not to implement Pepper</a>.
</p>

<h3>What is Portable Native Client (PNaCl)?</h3>

<p>
There are many different types of processors, each with its own type of native code.
One of the defining features of the web is that one page (or app) works everywhere:
on any browser, processor, or operating system. With native code applications,
this can't be true.
</p>

<p>
Portable Native Client (PNaCl) is the answer to this problem. PNaCl is an 
extension of NaCl that allows <a href="http://llvm.org/docs/BitCodeFormat.html">LLVM bitcode</a>
to be used as the format for NaCl applications. Bitcode is an abstract form of machine code, which
can be converted into the regular machine code of the target machine "on the fly". Thus, a single
bitcode executable will run on any computer, any operating system, and (eventually) any browser.
</p>

<p>
If you are curious, here's the <a href="doom.pexe">LLVM bitcode file (6MB)</a> which encodes DOOM.
</p>

<h3>Why are the graphics so blocky?</h3>

<p>
Those are the original 320 x 200 Doom graphics, scaled to fit the screen.
</p>
<p>
Doom is not really a 3D game, but actually a 2D game with perspective to appear 3D.
Everything is software generated, there is no hardware acceleration. There are
modern source ports of Doom with higher resolution graphics, but
this project uses the original code.
</p>

<h3>Why is there no music?</h3>

<p>
Unfortunately, SDL doom has no support for music.
</p>

<h3>Can I have the source code?</h3>
<p>
Of course. <a href="nacldoom.tar.bz2">nacldoom build directory</a>.
</p>

<p>
Warning: This is not a highly-polished. I made just enough changes to get everything to work. Be sure to read the README file.
