<p>This project aims to solve two problems, one problem for each type of user the app is designed to serve. The first problem the app aims to solve is to enable people to hire snow plowing professionals easily and efficiently, on-demand or based on configurable rules. Second, for snow plowing professionals, the app will enable them to connect to potential customers more easily, and to serve those customers better.</p>
